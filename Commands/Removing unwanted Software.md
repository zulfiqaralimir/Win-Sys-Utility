The image shows a command written in a Notepad file. The command is:

```bash
iwr -useb https://git.io/debloat | iex
```

### Explanation:
- **`iwr`**: This is short for `Invoke-WebRequest`, a PowerShell command used to download content from the web.
- **`-useb`**: This flag is used to specify that the command should use the basic functionality for web requests.
- **`https://git.io/debloat`**: This URL likely redirects to a script that is designed to "debloat" a Windows installation by removing unwanted pre-installed apps or configurations.
- **`| iex`**: This pipes (`|`) the downloaded script directly into the `iex` (Invoke-Expression) command, which executes the script.

### Usage:
This command is typically used to download and execute a script that "debloats" a Windows system, **removing unnecessary or unwanted software and settings to streamline the system**. This is often done to **optimize performance** and free up resources.
